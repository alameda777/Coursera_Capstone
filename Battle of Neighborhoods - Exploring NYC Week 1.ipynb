In order to solve this problem, I will explore all the boroughs of NYC to find the areas most populated with Colombian people. I will do this by finding out which borough has the larger number of Colombian restaurants this will give me the right indication where the Colombian population resides within NYC and therefore where is the best location for the new Colombian consulate, which needs to be close to the people that it will serve."
